# IC Drivers

Several IC manufacturers integrate their drivers with the MCU's peripheral driver library, which includes SPI, I2C, UART, and other necessary APIs, such as delay. As a result, migrating a project can be a time-consuming task. If we define the relevant MCU driver APIs that IC driver library will use, we only need to implement these APIs when migrating projects.
